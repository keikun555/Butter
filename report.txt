butter
Python implementation of the digital butterworth IIR filter

Dependencies
numpy -- used for its math modules and fast array calculations
numba -- used to increase calculation speed
Basic Usage
Importing the Butter module::

from butter import Butter

Creating the Butter instance for a lowpass butterworth filter with cutoff frequency 1000Hz and rolloff frequency 48Hz for data taken with sampling frequency 44100::

filter_ = Butter(btype="Lowpass", cutoff=1000, rolloff=48, sampling=44100)

Sending sample data into filter and retrieving the filtered data::

data=[1.0, -2.0, 3.0, . . . .] filtereddata = filter.send(data)

Retrieving forward-backward filtered data for the accumulated data::

data1=[1.0, -2.0, 3.0, . . . .] filtereddata = filter.send(data1) data2=[-1.0, 2.0, -3.0, . . . .] more_filtereddata = filter.send(data2) forward_backwards_filtereddata = filter.filtfilt()
